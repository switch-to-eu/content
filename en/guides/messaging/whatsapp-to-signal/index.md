## Why Switch to Signal?

While WhatsApp offers end-to-end encryption, there are several compelling reasons to switch to Signal:

- **Complete privacy**: Signal does not collect metadata about your communications
- **Open-source**: Signal's code is fully transparent and can be inspected by anyone
- **No ads or tracking**: Signal does not monetize your data in any way
- **Independent**: Managed by the Signal Foundation, a non-profit organization
- **EU-friendly**: Complies with GDPR and respects user privacy rights

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully migrated from WhatsApp to Signal. You are now using a more privacy-focused messaging app that respects your data and doesn't build profiles for advertising.

Remember that the network effect is important for messaging apps - the more friends you convince to join Signal, the more useful it becomes. Be patient during the transition period, as it may take time for your contacts to join you.
