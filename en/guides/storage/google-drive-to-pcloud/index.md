## Why Switch to pCloud?

More and more people are switching from Google Drive to pCloud. Below you can read why this might be a good choice:

- **Better protection of your privacy**: pCloud is based in Switzerland, where strict laws protect your personal data.

- **No data mining**: Unlike Google Drive, pCloud does not use your files for advertising or AI training.

- **One-time payment option for premium**: Instead of paying every month or year as with Google Drive, pCloud offers a one-time payment for lifetime access.

- **Longer file history**: If you accidentally make changes to a document, pCloud allows you to find previous versions going back up to a year (with paid subscription).

> **Important**: pCloud does not support document collaboration, such as shared editing of texts, spreadsheets, or presentations.

There are two ways to transfer your files from Google Drive to pCloud:

## Manual transfer

### Step 1: Downloading files from Google Drive

- Go to Google Drive and log in to your account.
- Select all files and folders you want to transfer.
- Right-click on the selection and choose "Download".
- The files will be downloaded as a ZIP file to your computer.
- Extract the ZIP file to a desired location on your computer.

### Step 2: Uploading files to pCloud

It's advisable to keep both your Google Drive and pCloud accounts for at least 2-3 months. This helps because:

- You might have forgotten to transfer certain files
- Some programs or websites may still try to use your Google Drive
- You have time to get familiar with how pCloud works

Check your Google Drive weekly to see if there are any new files that you need to transfer.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Problems And Solutions

- **The transfer takes a very long time**: With large amounts of files, the transfer can take several hours or even days. This is normal. Keep your computer on until it's finished.

- **Some files are not being transferred**: Check if the file is not too large for your pCloud account (the free version has limitations). Try transferring large files separately.

- **Shared files no longer work**: If you shared files with others via Google Drive, you need to share them again from pCloud. The sharing links from Google Drive will not work in pCloud.


### Where Can You Get Help?

If you have problems during the transfer:

- Visit the [pCloud Help page](https://www.pcloud.com/help)
- Send an email to [support@pCloud.com](mailto:support@pcloud.com)
- Call a family member or friend who is good with computers

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have transferred your files from Google Drive to pCloud. Your personal data is now better protected.

Continue to check your Google Drive regularly in the coming months to make sure you haven't missed anything.

pCloud not only offers better privacy but also the option to pay once instead of every month or year. This gives you more control over your digital life and your costs.
