Email is one of the most essential digital services we use daily. European email providers typically offer stronger privacy guarantees, data protection under GDPR, and often include features like end-to-end encryption, custom domains, and more.

EU-based email services typically don't scan your emails for advertising purposes and are less likely to share your data with third parties.
