Messaging apps are central to our personal and professional communications. European messaging services prioritize user privacy and data security, offering strong encryption and minimal data collection.

European messaging solutions often provide end-to-end encryption by default, avoid using your chat data for advertising purposes, and give you greater control over your personal information. Many also support multiple platforms and offer features like group chats, voice/video calls, and file sharing.
