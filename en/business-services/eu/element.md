Element is a modern team communication application built on the open Matrix protocol, focusing on privacy and security. Developed in the UK, it offers a secure alternative to proprietary chat platforms with end-to-end encryption as standard.

## Key Features

- **End-to-end encryption**: All messages are encrypted by default
- **Interoperability**: Compatible with other Matrix clients and platforms
- **Self-hosting**: Complete control over your own server and data
- **Cross-platform**: Works on all devices with synchronization
- **Bridge functionality**: Connect with Slack, Discord, Telegram and more
- **Compliance-ready**: GDPR-compliant with data residency options

## Privacy and Security

Element uses the Matrix protocol for decentralized, encrypted communication. All messages are end-to-end encrypted, meaning even Element servers cannot read the content. Self-hosting options give organizations complete control over their data.

## Ideal For

- Organizations prioritizing privacy and security
- Businesses in regulated sectors (healthcare, finance, legal)
- Teams wanting to avoid vendor lock-in
- Organizations with self-hosting requirements

## Pricing

Element offers free hosting for small teams and paid Element Matrix Services starting from €5/month per user. Enterprise and self-hosted options provide additional compliance and control features.
