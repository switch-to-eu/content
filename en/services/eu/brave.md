Brave is a free and open-source web browser focused on privacy. Created by Brendan Eich (co-founder of Mozilla and creator of JavaScript), Brave blocks ads and website trackers by default while maintaining high performance and usability.

## Key Features

- Built-in ad blocker and tracker prevention
- Private browsing with Tor integration
- Automatic HTTPS upgrades for enhanced security
- Anti-fingerprinting technology
- Brave Rewards program (optional) that allows users to earn Basic Attention Tokens (BAT)
- Cross-device synchronization with end-to-end encryption
- Compatible with Chrome extensions
- Mobile versions available for iOS and Android

## Privacy and Security

Brave stands out for its privacy-first approach with default settings that block tracking scripts, ads, and third-party cookies. Unlike many browsers, Brave starts with strong privacy protections enabled out of the box, reducing the need for additional extensions or complex configurations.

## Data Concerns

- While based in the US, Brave has been designed with privacy as a core principle
- Adheres to GDPR standards for all users
- Brave's business model does not rely on collecting or selling user data
- Optional features like Brave Rewards require some data collection, but are strictly opt-in
- Open-source code allows for community verification of privacy claims
- Local data storage prioritized over cloud storage where possible
