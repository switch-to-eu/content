# Guide Contributor's Documentation

Welcome to the Switch-to.EU guides documentation! This README provides everything you need to know about creating and maintaining migration guides for EU service alternatives.

## Guide Structure

Each migration guide should be placed in its appropriate category directory and follow this structure:

```
/content/guides/[category]/[service-name]/
├── index.mdx          # The main guide content
└── images/            # Images folder for screenshots and diagrams
    ├── step1.png
    ├── step2.png
    └── ...
```

## Guide Categories

Guides are organized by service category:

- `email` - Email services
- `storage` - Cloud storage services
- `messaging` - Chat and messaging applications
- `productivity` - Office and productivity tools
- `analytics` - Analytics and tracking tools

## Content Segmentation

Our platform supports logical content segmentation within MDX files. This makes content more maintainable and provides a better structure for guides while remaining readable in standard markdown editors.

### Segmentation Format

To segment your content, use the following syntax:

```md
---section:sectionname
Your markdown content goes here.
Content can span multiple paragraphs.
---
```

### Standard Sections

We recommend using these standard section names for guides:

- `intro`: Introduction and overview of the migration
- `before`: Prerequisites and preparation steps
- `steps`: The step-by-step migration process
- `troubleshooting`: Common issues and solutions
- `outro`: Conclusion and final notes

### Example of Segmented Content

Here's how a segmented guide should be structured:

```md
---
title: 'Migrating from Service A to Service B'
description: 'Step-by-step guide for moving from Service A to Service B'
difficulty: 'beginner'
timeRequired: '30 minutes'
sourceService: 'Service A'
targetService: 'Service B'
date: '2025-04-08'
author: 'Switch-to.EU Team'

# Migrating from Service A to Service B

---

---section:outro
## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully migrated from Service A to Service B.

---
```

### Backward Compatibility

The segmentation system is backward-compatible. Non-segmented content will continue to work correctly. If you're updating existing guides, consider adding segmentation to improve maintainability.

## Creating a New Guide

To create a new migration guide:

1. Identify the appropriate category for your guide
2. Create a new folder with a descriptive name (e.g., `gmail-to-protonmail`)
3. Copy the template from `/content/templates/guide-template.mdx`
4. Fill in all sections of the template
5. Add screenshots to the images folder

## Frontmatter Structure

Each guide should include frontmatter at the top of the MDX file with the following fields:

```mdx
---
title: "Migrating from [Service A] to [Service B]"
description: "A step-by-step guide to help you migrate from [Service A] to [Service B], an EU-based alternative."
publishedAt: "YYYY-MM-DD"
updatedAt: "YYYY-MM-DD"
author: "Your Name"
difficulty: "beginner|intermediate|advanced"
timeRequired: "X minutes|hours"
sourceService: "Service A"
targetService: "Service B"
sourceServiceUrl: "https://example.com"
targetServiceUrl: "https://eu-example.eu"
---
```

## Writing Guidelines

To ensure consistency across all guides:

1. **Be Clear and Concise** - Use simple language and short sentences
2. **Step-by-Step Format** - Number each step clearly and include screenshots
3. **Highlight Differences** - Note key differences between the source and target services
4. **Include Troubleshooting** - Add a section for common issues and solutions
5. **Keep It Current** - Update guides when services change

## Testing Your Guide

Before submitting a guide:

1. Follow your own instructions from start to finish
2. Test on different devices and browsers if relevant
3. Have someone else review and test the guide
