# Migrating from Gmail to ProtonMail

ProtonMail is a secure email service founded by scientists who met at CERN. It offers end-to-end encryption and a focus on privacy that Gmail doesn't provide. While technically based in Switzerland, ProtonMail adheres to GDPR and offers strong data protection aligning with EU values.

## Why Switch to ProtonMail?

Unlike Gmail, ProtonMail doesn't scan your emails for advertising purposes or build a profile about you. Your data is encrypted in a way that even ProtonMail can't access your emails.

- EU-aligned with strong data protection (Swiss privacy laws)
- End-to-end encryption
- No scanning of email content for ads
- Zero-access encryption (even ProtonMail can't read your emails)

## Before You Begin

### Prerequisites

- An active Gmail account
- A computer with internet access
- A mobile phone (for verification)

### What You'll Need

- A secure password for your new ProtonMail account
- Approximately 45 minutes to complete the migration
- Optional: A paid ProtonMail plan if you need additional storage or features

## Step 1: Create a ProtonMail Account

1. Visit [ProtonMail's website](https://proton.me/mail)
2. Click on "Get ProtonMail Free"
3. Choose your plan (Free or Paid)
4. Enter your desired username and a strong password
5. Complete the verification process
6. Once verified, log into your new ProtonMail account

> **Pro Tip:** Choose a strong, unique password for your ProtonMail account. Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords securely.

## Step 2: Export Your Gmail Contacts

1. Go to [Google Contacts](https://contacts.google.com)
2. Select the contacts you want to export (or click "Select all" to export everything)
3. Click "Export" from the menu
4. Choose "Google CSV" as the export format
5. Save the CSV file to your computer

## Step 3: Import Contacts to ProtonMail

1. Log in to your ProtonMail account
2. Go to Settings > Contacts
3. Click on "Import"
4. Select the CSV file you exported from Gmail
5. Map the fields if prompted
6. Click "Import" to add your contacts

## Step 4: Forward Important Emails

For important emails in your Gmail account:

1. In Gmail, select the emails you want to keep
2. Click the "Forward" button
3. Enter your ProtonMail address
4. Send the emails to your new account

For automated forwarding of future emails:

1. In Gmail, go to Settings > Forwarding and POP/IMAP
2. Click "Add a forwarding address"
3. Enter your ProtonMail address
4. Verify the forwarding address (you'll receive a confirmation email in ProtonMail)
5. Choose what Gmail should do with forwarded messages (mark as read, archive, etc.)

## Step 5: Update Your Accounts

1. Make a list of important services linked to your Gmail account
2. Visit each service and update your email address to your new ProtonMail address
3. Update your recovery email for important accounts
4. Don't forget to update:
   - Banking services
   - Social media accounts
   - Subscription services
   - Online shopping accounts

## Step 6: Set Up Email Clients (Optional)

To use ProtonMail with desktop email clients:

1. For paid ProtonMail plans, download the [ProtonMail Bridge](https://proton.me/mail/bridge)
2. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system
3. Configure your email client using the settings provided by ProtonMail Bridge

## Step 7: Transition Period

Maintain both email accounts for at least a month to:

1. Catch any services you forgot to update
2. Ensure you're receiving all important communications
3. Get comfortable with the ProtonMail interface

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Missing emails**: Check spam/junk folders in ProtonMail
- **Attachment size limits**: ProtonMail's free plan has a 25MB attachment limit
- **Email formatting**: Some complex email formatting may not transfer perfectly

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues during migration:

- Visit [ProtonMail's Support Center](https://proton.me/support/mail)
- Check the [ProtonMail Knowledgebase](https://proton.me/support/knowledge-base)
- Contact ProtonMail support via your account settings

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully migrated from Gmail to ProtonMail. Your email communications are now more private and secure. Remember to periodically check your old Gmail account during the transition period to ensure you haven't missed anything important.
