Infomaniak Mail is a comprehensive Swiss email service developed by the employee-owned Infomaniak company, founded in 1994 and serving over one million professional email addresses across Europe. Unlike purely encrypted email services, Infomaniak Mail focuses on business productivity and professional communication while maintaining Swiss data sovereignty and privacy protection. The service combines traditional email functionality with modern AI-powered features, integrated productivity tools, and enterprise-grade management capabilities, making it ideal for businesses seeking a professional alternative to Big Tech email providers.

## Key Features

Infomaniak Mail provides unlimited email storage on paid plans with 20GB free storage, hosted exclusively in Switzerland across multiple secure data centers with automatic backups. The service integrates Swiss-hosted AI features for email composition, grammar correction, translation, and intelligent response suggestions, ensuring productivity enhancements without compromising data privacy. Unlike cloud-based AI services, all processing occurs within Switzerland using Infomaniak's sovereign infrastructure.

The platform includes comprehensive productivity tools with integrated calendar management, contact synchronization, task organization, and seamless integration with kDrive cloud storage for unlimited file attachments. Professional features include custom domain support, corporate branding options, single sign-on (SSO) integration, and advanced user management for teams up to 300 users. The service automatically protects against spam, phishing, and malware with over 99.9% effectiveness while supporting SPF, DKIM, and DMARC authentication protocols.

Migration tools facilitate easy transition from existing email providers with automatic import of emails, contacts, calendars, and folder structures. Cross-platform access is provided through dedicated mobile apps, webmail interface, and standard email client compatibility (IMAP/POP3/SMTP) for seamless workflow integration.

## Privacy and Security

Infomaniak Mail operates under Switzerland's strict data protection framework, ensuring full GDPR and nFADP compliance with transparent privacy practices. As an employee-owned company with no external investors, Infomaniak prioritizes user interests over profit maximization, maintaining a business model that doesn't rely on data analysis or advertising revenue. All user data remains exclusively within Swiss borders, protected by some of the world's strongest privacy legislation.

The service employs comprehensive security measures including data encryption in transit and at rest, multi-data center redundancy, 30-day data recovery capabilities, and regular third-party security audits. While not providing end-to-end encryption like ProtonMail or Tutanota, Infomaniak Mail offers enterprise-grade security suitable for professional environments requiring reliable communication and data sovereignty. The company's transparent approach includes detailed privacy policies and security documentation.

Infomaniak's independent infrastructure provides enhanced security through reduced attack vectors, as the company controls the entire technology stack from data centers to application development. This Swiss-made approach ensures protection from foreign surveillance laws while maintaining compatibility with standard business processes and regulatory requirements.
