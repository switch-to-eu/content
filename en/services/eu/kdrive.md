kDrive is a premium Swiss cloud storage and collaboration platform developed by Infomaniak, an independent employee-owned company founded in 1994. As part of Switzerland's sovereign cloud infrastructure, kDrive represents a comprehensive alternative to Big Tech cloud services, designed specifically to meet European privacy standards and data sovereignty requirements. The service combines secure file storage with advanced collaboration tools, offering businesses and individuals complete control over their data while maintaining the highest levels of privacy and security standards.

## Key Features

kDrive provides enterprise-grade cloud storage with capacities ranging from 2TB to over 106TB, all hosted exclusively in Switzerland across two secure data centers with triple backup protection. The platform integrates seamlessly with both OnlyOffice and Microsoft 365, allowing real-time collaborative editing of documents, spreadsheets, and presentations directly within the Swiss-hosted environment. This unique approach ensures Microsoft Office functionality while maintaining complete data sovereignty.

The service includes advanced AI-powered features for intelligent document search, content analysis of PDFs and images, and automated file organization. Users benefit from sophisticated sharing capabilities including password-protected links, expiration dates, drop boxes for secure file collection, and custom branding options that maintain corporate identity throughout the collaboration process. Version control and file recovery features provide comprehensive data protection with the ability to restore previous document versions at any time.

kDrive's migration tools automatically import content from existing cloud services like Google Drive, Dropbox, and OneDrive, making the transition seamless. The platform supports single sign-on (SSO) integration for enterprise environments and offers extensive customization options including custom domains, logos, and color schemes.

## Privacy and Security

kDrive operates under Switzerland's stringent data protection framework, complying with both GDPR and the new Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (nFADP). As a truly sovereign cloud service, all data remains exclusively within Swiss borders, processed only by open-source software or solutions developed in-house by Infomaniak. This architecture ensures that foreign authorities cannot access user data without following proper Swiss legal channels.

The platform employs end-to-end encryption for all stored data, with triple backup across geographically separated Swiss data centers ensuring maximum data resilience. Unlike conventional cloud providers, Infomaniak maintains a strict no-analysis policy - user data is never examined, profiled, or used for commercial purposes. The company's employee-owned structure eliminates external investor pressure that might compromise privacy principles.

Infomaniak's commitment to digital sovereignty extends to their infrastructure choices, utilizing European hardware and open-source technologies while maintaining complete independence from American and Chinese cloud giants. Regular security audits and continuous monitoring ensure enterprise-grade protection suitable for compliance-heavy industries including healthcare, finance, and legal services.
