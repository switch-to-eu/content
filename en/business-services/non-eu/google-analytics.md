Google Analytics is the world's most widely used web analytics platform, part of Google's advertising ecosystem. While it offers extensive analytics, there are significant privacy and compliance challenges for European businesses.

## Privacy and Compliance Issues

Google Analytics has been deemed non-GDPR compliant by various European privacy authorities. The platform collects extensive user data and stores it on American servers, where US legislation grants broad access to authorities. The data may also be used for Google's advertising platform.

## Legal Challenges

Several EU countries have banned websites from using Google Analytics due to GDPR violations. The European Data Protection Board has made it clear that transferring personal data to the US via Google Analytics is problematic without adequate protection measures.

## Cookie Compliance Complexity

Google Analytics requires complex cookie consent implementations to be GDPR compliant. Many businesses struggle with correctly implementing consent, which can lead to fines and legal issues.

## Ideal For

- Businesses already fully dependent on Google's ecosystem
- Websites with extensive e-commerce tracking needs
- Organizations without strict privacy compliance requirements
- Teams requiring advanced integration with Google Ads
