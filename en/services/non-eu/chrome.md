Chrome is a free web browser developed by Google. Launched in 2008, it has grown to become the most widely used browser globally, known for its speed, simplicity, and extensive support for web standards and extensions.


## Privacy and Security

Chrome is developed by Google, a company whose business model is largely based on data collection and targeted advertising. While Chrome offers security features, it collects a significant amount of user data by default that is shared within the Google ecosystem.

## Data Concerns

- Collects extensive browsing history, location data, and usage patterns
- Data is stored on servers in the US
- Subject to US surveillance laws
- Offers web search functionality directly from the address bar (data is sent to Google)
- Integrates strongly with other Google services, promoting shared data collection
- Not designed with EU data protection as a primary focus
- Default settings are not optimized for privacy
