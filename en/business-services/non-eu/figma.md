Figma is a cloud-based design tool owned by Adobe and used by millions of designers worldwide for UI/UX design, prototyping, and collaboration. While it offers powerful functionality, it's based in the United States and subject to American data laws.

## Privacy and Data Concerns

Figma stores all design files, including sensitive business data and intellectual property, on American servers. This means your business data is subject to US legislation, including the CLOUD Act, allowing American authorities to demand access to your design data.

## Vendor Lock-in Risk

As part of Adobe's ecosystem, Figma uses proprietary file formats that make migration to other platforms difficult. Adobe has also raised prices since the acquisition, increasing total cost of ownership for businesses.

## Ideal For

- Teams already fully invested in Adobe's ecosystem
- Projects requiring collaboration with external parties using Figma
- Businesses not bound by European data localization requirements
