Social media plays an important role in our daily lives for both personal and professional purposes. European social media platforms operate under strict GDPR regulations and prioritize user privacy and transparency in data processing.

Social networks based in the EU typically collect less personal data, provide better control over privacy settings, and don't use your data for targeted advertising without explicit consent. These platforms often offer similar features to their international counterparts, but with a stronger focus on user rights and data protection.
