# Signal

Signal is an end-to-end encrypted messaging service focused on privacy and security. While the Signal Foundation is US-based, the service operates in a distributed manner and is recommended by privacy advocates worldwide including in the EU.

## Key Features

- Industry-leading encryption protocol (used by WhatsApp and others)
- Voice and video calls with end-to-end encryption
- Group chats and group calls
- Disappearing messages with custom time settings
- Screen security features to prevent screenshots
- Desktop and mobile apps for all major platforms

## Privacy and Security

Signal provides best-in-class privacy with end-to-end encryption for all communications. The open-source code allows independent verification of security claims. Signal is designed to collect minimal metadata, and even implemented innovative techniques to avoid storing user data. The app uses local storage for messages rather than cloud backups, enhancing privacy but requiring manual transfers when changing devices.
