## Why Switch to ProtonMail?

Unlike Gmail, ProtonMail doesn't scan your emails for advertising purposes or build a profile about you. Your data is encrypted in a way that even ProtonMail can't access your emails.

- **EU-compliant**: Strong data protection (Swiss privacy laws)
- **End-to-end encryption**: Maximum security for your messages
- **No scanning** of email content for advertisements
- **Zero-access encryption**: Even ProtonMail can't read your emails
