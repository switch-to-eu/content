Microsoft Edge is the web browser developed by Microsoft. In 2020, Edge was completely rebuilt based on the Chromium engine, making it compatible with most Chrome extensions while maintaining special Microsoft features like enhanced privacy settings and productivity tools.

## Privacy and Security

Edge is developed by Microsoft and includes various privacy settings, but by default collects user data to improve the browser experience and personalization. While Microsoft performs better in some aspects of privacy than other large tech companies, data is still primarily stored on US servers.

## Data Concerns

- Collects and processes browsing history for personalization
- Stores user data on US servers
- Subject to US surveillance laws
- May use browsing data for ad targeting within the Microsoft ecosystem
- AI features like Edge Copilot may introduce additional privacy risks
- Sharing of data between Microsoft services
- Less transparent about specific data collection than EU alternatives
