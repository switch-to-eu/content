Bing is Microsoft's web search engine that competes with Google Search. Launched in 2009, it provides search services for web pages, images, videos, maps, and news, with a focus on visual presentation and integration with Microsoft's suite of products.

## Privacy and Security

Bing is developed by Microsoft, whose business model includes data collection for service improvement and advertising. While Bing offers some privacy controls, it collects significant amounts of user data by default that is used for personalization and targeting.

## Data Concerns

- Collects search queries and browsing history
- Data is stored on servers in the US
- Subject to US surveillance laws
- Uses search data for personalization and advertising profiles
- Integrates with Microsoft account and other Microsoft services
- Default settings are optimized for service functionality rather than privacy
- AI features may collect and process additional conversation data
- Search data retention policies allow for extended storage periods
