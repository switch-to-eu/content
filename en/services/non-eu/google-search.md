Google Search is the dominant search engine worldwide, handling billions of searches daily. Launched in 1998, it has evolved into a sophisticated search tool with advanced algorithms that analyze user intent and deliver personalized results.

## Privacy and Security

Google's business model relies heavily on data collection and targeted advertising. While Google Search offers convenient features, it collects significant amounts of user data including search history, location, and device information to build comprehensive user profiles.

## Data Concerns

- Collects and stores all search queries linked to user profiles
- Data is stored on servers in the US
- Subject to US surveillance laws
- Uses search data to build advertising profiles
- Location tracking is often enabled by default
- Results are personalized based on collected data, creating potential filter bubbles
- Default settings prioritize service functionality over privacy
- Strong integration with other Google services encourages data sharing across platforms
