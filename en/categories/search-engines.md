Search engines are essential tools we use to navigate the web and discover information. European search engines often prioritize user privacy, data sovereignty, and compliance with GDPR regulations.

EU-based search engines typically offer features such as no user tracking, no personalized search results based on your profile, and transparent data handling practices. These alternatives give you the ability to search the web without sacrificing your privacy or contributing to data surveillance ecosystems.
