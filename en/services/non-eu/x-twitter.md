X, formerly known as Twitter, is a social network and microblogging platform where users can post short messages, known as "tweets" or now "posts". The platform was founded in 2006 and was acquired by Elon Musk in 2022, after which it was rebranded to "X" in 2023.

## Privacy and Security

X (formerly Twitter) has a mixed reputation in terms of privacy and security. While the platform offers end-to-end encryption for direct messages, its business model still relies on data collection for targeted advertising. Following the acquisition by Elon Musk, various changes have been made to privacy policies and platform guidelines.

## Data Concerns

- Collects extensive user data, including interaction patterns and preferences
- Recent changes in policy and leadership have heightened concerns about data protection
- Data stored on US servers, outside EU jurisdiction
- Subject to US surveillance laws
- Algorithms can contribute to the spread of misinformation
- Reduced content standards and moderation may amplify problematic content
- Less transparency about data usage since rebranding to X
