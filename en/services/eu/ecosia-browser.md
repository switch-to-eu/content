# Ecosia Browser

Ecosia Browser is a privacy-focused web browser developed by Ecosia GmbH, a Berlin-based company. Built on Chromium (the open-source project behind Google Chrome), the browser combines privacy features with environmental activism. Ecosia is primarily known for its search engine that uses ad revenue to plant trees, and the browser extends this mission by integrating their eco-friendly search engine and adding unique environmental features.

## Key Features

- Built-in ad and tracker blocking to protect your privacy
- Automatic cookie consent management to reject non-essential cookies
- Privacy panel that warns about unsafe sites
- Integration with Ecosia search engine, which plants trees with search revenue
- Produces 25Wh of renewable energy each day you browse

- Built-in AI chatbot with a special "Green Mode" for environmentally-friendly answers
- Affiliate program that contributes to climate action when you shop online

## Privacy and Security

Ecosia Browser includes several privacy features, such as blocking ads and trackers by default, managing cookie consent popups automatically, and warning about unsafe sites. The browser does not create personal profiles based on your search history or use external tracking tools, though some basic data like IP addresses may be shared with search partners to provide results and prevent fraudulent activity.

## Ideal For

- Environmentally-conscious users who want to contribute to climate action
- People looking for a simpler, privacy-focused alternative to mainstream browsers
- Users who want automatic ad-blocking and cookie management
- Those who prefer a browser with built-in eco-friendly features
