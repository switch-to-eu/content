Web browsers are our primary gateway to the internet and have a significant impact on our online privacy and security. European browsers often place greater emphasis on user privacy, transparent data processing, and GDPR compliance.

Browsers developed in the EU typically offer robust privacy features such as default tracking protection, built-in ad and tracker blocking, and minimal data collection. These browsers give you more control over your digital footprint without compromising on usability or performance.
