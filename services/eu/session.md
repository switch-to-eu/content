# Session

Session is a privacy-focused messaging application that uses a decentralized network to provide anonymous communication without requiring personal identifiers like phone numbers or email addresses. While the developers are based in Australia, the application operates on a decentralized network with strong European usage and node participation.

## Key Features

- End-to-end encryption for all messages and attachments
- No phone number or email address required for signup
- Onion routing to hide IP addresses and metadata
- Decentralized architecture with no central servers
- Group chats, voice messages, and attachments
- Open-source codebase for security verification
- Cross-platform support (mobile and desktop)

## Privacy and Security

Session takes privacy to the next level by addressing metadata collection, which many other secure messengers still expose. It uses onion routing (similar to Tor) to hide user IPs and routes messages through a decentralized network of nodes rather than central servers. The app doesn't require any personal identifiers, generating a random Session ID for communication instead. Messages are stored encrypted on the network for reliable message delivery without sacrificing privacy.

## Ideal For

- Users seeking maximum anonymity and privacy
- Privacy advocates wanting metadata protection
- People who cannot or do not want to share phone numbers
- Users in sensitive situations who need to protect their identity
- Those looking for a truly decentralized messaging solution
