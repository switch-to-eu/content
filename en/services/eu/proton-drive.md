Proton Drive is a privacy-first cloud storage service developed by the same Swiss-based team that created Proton Mail, founded by CERN scientists in 2014. Built on the principle that everyone deserves digital privacy, Proton Drive offers end-to-end encrypted cloud storage where only you can access your files. The service officially launched in September 2022 after extensive beta testing and has quickly become a trusted alternative to Big Tech cloud storage solutions. Operating under Switzerland's world-renowned privacy laws, Proton Drive ensures your data remains protected from surveillance, data mining, and unauthorized access.

## Key Features

Proton Drive provides comprehensive cloud storage functionality with military-grade security at its core. The service employs zero-access encryption, meaning your files, file names, and metadata are encrypted on your device before being uploaded to Proton's servers. This approach ensures that even Proton's own staff cannot access your data, providing true privacy by design. The platform supports seamless file synchronization across all major platforms including web browsers, Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS devices.

The service includes a built-in collaborative document editor called Docs, which enables real-time editing, commenting, and suggestions while maintaining end-to-end encryption throughout the collaboration process. Users can securely share files and folders with granular control, including password protection, expiration dates, and the ability to revoke access at any time. Additional features include automatic photo backup, album organization for photos and videos, file versioning for data safety, and unlimited file size support for sharing.

Recent updates have introduced enhanced collaboration tools, improved desktop app performance with up to 2x faster upload and download speeds, and new formatting options in the document editor. The service continues to expand with features like photo albums, enhanced folder sync, and streamlined collaboration workflows.

## Privacy and Security

Proton Drive's security architecture is built on Swiss privacy laws, widely considered among the strongest in the world. The company operates data centers in Switzerland, Germany, and Norway, with the primary infrastructure located in Switzerland including a backup facility in a former military bunker under 1,000 meters of granite rock. This geographical advantage means Proton Drive operates outside the 5/9/14 Eyes intelligence-sharing alliances, providing additional protection against mass surveillance.

The service uses OpenPGP end-to-end encryption combined with elliptic curve cryptography to protect all data both at rest and in transit. All applications are open-source, allowing independent security experts to verify the encryption implementation. Regular third-party security audits are conducted by firms like Securitum, with no major security vulnerabilities discovered. The company maintains a transparent approach with regular transparency reports detailing any legal requests received from Swiss authorities.

Proton Drive is fully GDPR compliant, offering users complete control over their data including the right to access, download, or delete their information. The service operates on a zero-logging policy and has a strict no-advertising business model, ensuring user data is never monetized or shared with third parties.
