GoDaddy is the world's largest domain registrar with over 84 million registered domain names. While it offers an extensive range of services, there are ethical and privacy concerns for conscious consumers.

## Market Position vs Ethical Concerns

GoDaddy's dominant market position comes with controversial practices, including selling customer data to third parties for marketing purposes and aggressive upselling techniques that can drive up costs.

## Privacy and Data Practices

The company has a history of selling customer information and browser data to advertisers. WHOIS privacy protection is offered as a paid service, while many modern registrars provide this as standard.

## Complex Pricing Structure

GoDaddy employs a complex pricing strategy with low introductory rates that increase significantly upon renewal. Many essential services like privacy protection and DNS management are offered as paid add-ons.

## Ideal For

- Businesses needing the largest selection of domain extensions
- Organizations that don't object to American hosting
- Users wanting an all-in-one platform despite ethical concerns
- Business customers with complex domain portfolio needs
