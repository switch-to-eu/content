Threema is a privacy-focused messaging app based in Switzerland that emphasizes metadata minimization and allows anonymous usage without requiring a phone number or email address.

## Key Features

- End-to-end encryption for all communications
- Can be used without providing personal information (no phone number required)
- Web client for desktop use
- QR code contact verification for enhanced security
- Self-destructing messages and media
- Voice and video calls with encryption
- Polls, file sharing, and group chats

## Privacy and Security

Based in Switzerland, Threema benefits from strong privacy laws. All messages are end-to-end encrypted, and the service minimizes metadata collection. The app generates a random Threema ID instead of using your phone number as your identity, allowing for anonymous communication. Messages are stored locally on your device, not on Threema's servers, and can be protected with a PIN or biometrics.

## Ideal For

- Users seeking the highest level of privacy and anonymity
- People who don't want to share their phone number
- Privacy advocates who prefer a one-time payment over a free service
- Organizations looking for a secure, GDPR-compliant messaging solution
