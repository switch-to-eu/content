# Migrating from Google Drive to Nextcloud

Nextcloud is a self-hosted productivity platform that provides functionality similar to Google Drive but with full control over your data. It's an open-source solution that aligns with EU digital sovereignty principles.

## Why Switch to Nextcloud?

Google Drive stores your data on Google's servers, where it can be analyzed for advertising purposes. Nextcloud, on the other hand, can be hosted in the EU on servers compliant with GDPR regulations, giving you:

- Complete data ownership
- Enhanced privacy protection
- No tracking or profiling
- Freedom from vendor lock-in
