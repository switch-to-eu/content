Cloud storage is essential for keeping your files accessible across devices and sharing them with others. European storage providers operate under GDPR protections and often provide better privacy controls than their US counterparts.

European cloud storage solutions typically offer features like end-to-end encryption, self-hosting options, and transparent data handling policies. Many also provide additional collaboration tools and office suite integrations.
