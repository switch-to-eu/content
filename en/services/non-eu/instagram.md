Instagram is a social media platform focused on sharing photos and videos. It was launched in 2010 and has been owned by Meta (formerly Facebook) since 2012. The platform is known for its visual focus and has expanded its functionality to include stories, direct messaging, and short videos (Reels).

## Privacy and Security

As part of Meta (Facebook), Instagram has a similar business model that heavily relies on collecting user data for targeted advertising. The platform is known for its algorithmically driven content designed to maximize user engagement, sometimes at the expense of privacy and digital wellbeing.

- Shares user data within the Meta ecosystem (Facebook, WhatsApp)
- Uses advanced facial recognition and image analysis technologies
- Data stored on US servers, outside EU jurisdiction
- Subject to US surveillance laws
- Algorithms are designed to maximize engagement, which can lead to addictive behavior
- Extensive tracking of user interactions and preferences
- Limited transparency about how user data is precisely used
