Filen is a next-generation encrypted cloud storage service founded in 2020 in Recklinghausen, Germany, by a team of German cybersecurity enthusiasts committed to providing maximum privacy and security. Built from the ground up with zero-knowledge end-to-end encryption, Filen ensures that neither the company nor any third parties can access user data. Operating exclusively from Germany with servers housed in ISO 27001 certified Tier IV data centers, Filen represents a completely independent alternative to Big Tech cloud storage, emphasizing transparency, privacy, and user control.

## Key Features

Filen implements client-side AES 256-bit encryption, meaning all data is encrypted on the user's device before transmission, ensuring absolute privacy protection. The platform offers comprehensive cloud storage functionality including file synchronization across all platforms with five versatile sync modes, from automatic two-way syncing to specialized backup configurations. Unlike many competitors, Filen provides unlimited bandwidth without speed restrictions, allowing users to upload and download as much data as their connection permits.

The service extends beyond basic storage with encrypted notes supporting rich text, code, markdown, and checklists, plus end-to-end encrypted chat functionality for secure team collaboration. Advanced features include network drive mounting, Smart Sync for instant file access, file versioning without limits, and professional developer tools including CLI, TypeScript and Go SDKs, plus self-hosted WebDAV and S3 server capabilities.

All Filen applications are open-source under the AGPL v3 license, allowing complete transparency and community auditing of security implementations. The platform supports seamless integration across web browsers, desktop applications (Windows, macOS, Linux), and mobile devices (iOS, Android).

## Privacy and Security

Filen operates under Germany's strict data protection framework with full GDPR compliance and adherence to German privacy laws, offering some of Europe's highest privacy standards. The company's zero-knowledge architecture ensures that encryption keys never leave user devices, making it technically impossible for Filen to access stored data even if compelled by authorities. All data is stored exclusively in German data centers with Tier IV security certification and ISO 27001 compliance.

The service's commitment to transparency extends to its open-source codebase, allowing independent security experts to verify encryption implementations and audit for potential vulnerabilities. As a completely self-funded company without external investors, Filen maintains independence from corporate pressures that might compromise user privacy. The company has plans for professional security audits to further validate its security architecture.

Filen's technical design prioritizes user control with client-side encryption, zero data collection beyond essential service requirements, and a privacy policy notable for its brevity and clarity. The service offers two-factor authentication and maintains detailed technical documentation explaining its encryption processes.
