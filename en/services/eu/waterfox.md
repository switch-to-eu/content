Waterfox is a free and open-source web browser developed in the United Kingdom, originally as a 64-bit alternative to Firefox. The browser focuses on privacy, speed, and user control, and has been developed by Alex Kontos since 2011. Waterfox operates under UK and EU data protection legislation.

## Key Features

- Telemetry is disabled by default â€“ no usage data is collected
- Built-in tracker protection against advertisement trackers
- Support for 'Oblivious DNS' that makes it harder for your internet provider to track your website connections
- Container tabs help organize your browser activities by separating your work, shopping, or personal browsing
- Compatible with Firefox extensions, as well as extensions from Google Chrome and Opera
- Private tabs can be opened without opening a fully private window
- Built-in uBlock Origin adblocker for additional privacy protection and faster browsing

## Privacy and Security

Waterfox distinguishes itself by offering a browser where privacy features are enabled by default, unlike other browsers where you need to enable these yourself. The browser collects minimal technical data (only necessary information to provide updates) and does not store personal data. The built-in tracker protection blocks advertising networks and other online trackers, enhancing your online privacy.

## Ideal For

- Privacy-conscious users looking for an alternative to large commercial browsers
- People who want a customizable browser experience without technical complexity
- Users who appreciate Firefox's functionality but with less data collection
- Anyone who values speed and performance without compromising on security
