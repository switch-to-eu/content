Gmail is a free email service developed by Google. Launched in 2004, it has become one of the most widely used email services worldwide, known for its storage capacity, search capabilities, and integration with other Google services.

## Privacy and Security

Gmail is operated by Google, which has a business model primarily centered around data collection and targeted advertising. While Gmail offers security features like two-factor authentication, its privacy practices involve scanning email content for various purposes.

## Data Concerns

- Google scans email content for feature purposes (and previously for advertising)
- Data is stored primarily on U.S. servers
- Subject to U.S. surveillance laws
- User data can be used for personalization across Google services
- Google's privacy policy allows for extensive data collection
- Not designed with EU data protection standards as the primary focus
- May not fully comply with data sovereignty requirements
